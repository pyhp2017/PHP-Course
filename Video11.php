/********************************
 * Includes
 */

// PHP within included files must also begin with a PHP open tag.

// include 'Video11Include.php';

// The code in Video11Include.php.php is now available in the current scope.
// If the file cannot be included (e.g. file not found), a warning is emitted.

// include_once 'my-file.php';

// If the code in Video11Include.php has been included elsewhere, it will
// not be included again. This prevents multiple class declaration errors

// require 'Video11Include.php';
// require_once 'Video11Include.php';

// Same as include(), except require() will cause a fatal error if the
// file cannot be included.


// Includes and requires may also return a value.
// $value = include 'Video11MyInclude.php';
// echo $value;
